# Option Pricing Library

This is an option pricing library that was created in 1996 to implement common option 
pricing formulas. It was distributed as freeware in order to build a consulting practice in the 
energy industry.

## Usage

You will probably want to use this as inspiration for your own option pricing functions or tools. 
In the original product, there were bindings to attach these functions to Excel as an add-in.
But, this code was fussy and Windows specific so has not been included.
